# Eventful
## A little widget that is intended to track events on a page.

This widget, built with a simple React frontend is intended to be used to track live events on elements marked for tracking.

### Remaining Tasks
- Abstract event handling to effectively handle different types of events (currently tested to handle click).
- Set up event unbinding
- Improve the interface to offer:
  - display options,
  - tabs for different event types,
  - input for creating different types of elements
  - input for toggling the tracking of different events.
  - Use of clean icons (toggle, settings, event-specific logos, etc.)
  - Styling to gracefully integrate with a given site.
- Create a nicely formatted collection of event data.
- Create an API and corresponding data store for tracking event data over time.
- Expose the widget to settings using a vanilla JS library.
- Allow for the dynamic creation of elements.

#### Lots to do. Enjoy!
